# Kaggle 2025 Bank Classification

Binary classification on bank marketing data for the August 2025 Kaggle Playground Series.

## Problem Statement

Predict whether a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit.

This is a binary classification problem:  
- `1` = subscribed  
- `0` = did not subscribe
